● Python program to visualize reported life satisfaction (LSATISFY) per US state with data taken from the US Center for Disease Control's (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey datasets.

● Creates, trains, and uses a Tensorflow feed-forward neural network to predict average values for states that did not get the BRFSS life satisfaction question or had too few respondents to be included. The model is trained on metrics from the 2022 and 2023 BRFSS datasets such as income, population change, and metropolitan status.

● Reported and predicted life satisfaction values are projected onto a generated map of the United States.
